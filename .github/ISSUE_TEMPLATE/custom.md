Please start a new discussion instead of creating a new issue. I will then create an issue if needed. The idea is that we can have a longer discussion, and after a solution has been found and decisions made, an issue will be created that contains just a summary and most important decisions from the discussion.

Please create your discussion in one of the following discussion categories:
- [Debugging and testing](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/categories/debugging-and-testing): For suspected bugs or weird things.
- [Ideas](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/categories/ideas): For feature requests.
- [Q & A](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/categories/q-a): Questions if you need help. You can also ask for help regarding what kind of shell commands you can use to do a certain thing that you have on your mind - the question doesn't have to directly relate to how to define the command in this plugin, you can ask more generally about different commands.
- If you are uncertain on which category you should post, just post to [Q & A](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/categories/q-a).

(I haven't found a setting from GitHub that would prevent normal users from creating new issues, which is why I can't technically lock new issue creation, so I decided to write this issue template to guide towards creating discussions.)
